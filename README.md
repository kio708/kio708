### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Kio708
I have just started my software engineering studies at SÃ¸nderborg University (that's in denmark).
I am happy to finally be able to dive deep into the diffrent areas of software and have the opportunity to meet many other people that have the same interests as me.

Lately I have been working on creating my own website to use as a central are of my social media accounts and small projects I have been working on.
The page is sadly inavailable online as I didn't want to buy a domain name and server yet and it is not available on github either because I haven't been able to get the file paths to work correclty. :(

In the future I would like to create a Chrome/Firefox addon that allows you to use language mixed subtitles for anime.
As I have been trying to learn japanese but using japanese subtitles leads to me not understanding anything and therefor not enjoying it as much, but using english subtitles hinders me from learning japanese.

If you believe I can help you in some way, either by answering certain questions or by collaborating on a project, or just want to play osu! with me because you enjoy it as much as I do, pleas reach out to me on discord. (It's kio708 there aswell)
